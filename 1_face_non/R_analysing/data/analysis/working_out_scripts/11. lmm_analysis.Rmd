## CHEEK 

### Cheek LMM Model 1 (intercepts only)
This model predicts Zdiff from fixed effects of condition (happy, negative) and bin (1-10),  and their interactions (condition x bin). 

It includes random intercepts for participant (accounting for the potential of some kids to just have more active faces than others) and random intercepts for trials (accounting for the possibiity that face activation differs across the the 10 trials). This model doesnâ€™t include slopes (yet).
#### construct model 

```{r}
lm_face_cheek <- lmer(Zdiff ~ condition + bin + condition*bin + (1|pp_no), data = face_cheek, REML = FALSE) 

```

#### use anova to estimate effects
```{r}
anova(lm_face_cheek)
```

#### use summary to get coefficients

```{r}
summary(lm_face_cheek)
```

check if normality assumptions are met 

``` {r}

plot(lm_face_cheek)

qqnorm(resid(lm_face_cheek))
qqline(resid(lm_face_cheek)) # spoiler alert they aren't

```

#### transform to correct normality
Usually we would log transform but the Zdiff includes negative values. Alternative = log modulus transform. This transformation log transforms the absolute value (without the -) and then puts the sign back on). Make a new column for log modulus.
``` {r}
face_cheek <- face_cheek %>%
  mutate(log_modulus = sign(Zdiff) * log(1+abs(Zdiff)))

# run new model 

lm_face_cheek_1 <- lmer(log_modulus ~ condition + bin + condition:bin + (1|pp_no), data = face_cheek, REML = FALSE)
```

#### test assumptions again 
Residuals are more evenly distributed than before, qq plot is SO much better (at least the sample quantiles are on the same scale). It is not great but maybe the best we can do.

```{r}
plot(lm_face_cheek_1)

qqnorm(resid(lm_face_cheek_1))
qqline(resid(lm_face_cheek_1))

```

#### use anova to estimate effects

``` {r}
# use anova to estimate effects
anova_f_cheek_1 <- anova(lm_face_cheek_1) %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  rename(term = rowname)

anova_f_cheek_2 <- anova(lm_face_cheek_2)  %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  rename(term = rowname)

```
